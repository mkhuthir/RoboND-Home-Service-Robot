## How to clone workspcae from this repository

#### clone this repository to `~/catkin_ws` folder 

```bash
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/mkhuthir/RoboND-Home-Service-Robot.git catkin_ws
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ ls
```
#### Initilize all registered git submodules and update them.

You will be using the following ROS packages:

* **gmapping**: With the `gmapping_demo.launch` file, you can easily perform SLAM and build a map of the environment with a robot equipped with laser range finder sensors or RGB-D cameras.

* **turtlebot_teleop**: With the `keyboard_teleop.launch` file, you can manually control a robot using keyboard commands.

* **turtlebot_rviz_launchers**: With the `view_navigation.launch` file, you can load a preconfigured rviz workspace. Youâ€™ll save a lot of time by launching this file, because it will automatically load the robot model, trajectories, and map for you.

* **turtlebot_gazebo**: With the `turtlebot_world.launch` you can deploy a turtlebot in a gazebo environment by linking the world file to it.

packages are already included in git repository as submodules, you will need to initialize it and update it.

```bash
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```
#### Install ROS Navigation system

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-navigation
```

### install xterm if you dont have it
